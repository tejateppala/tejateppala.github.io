Being from a marginalized community, my father had to overcome many systemic barriers to be where he is today. He was able to get mentoring and support to get into medical school which helped lift him out of poverty. Growing up I had a great interest in doing science experiments at home, which was supported by my parents’ efforts. Once in college, I started observing the systemic inequality in education and opportunity around me. Motivated by a desire to effect change, I began my journey in outreach in 2013. I have since committed to making science more accessible, to fostering curiosity, critical thinking, and scientific literacy amongst students of all backgrounds.

I have continued this journey after coming to the US for graduate school. As a volunteer at the Laws Observatory on campus, I have been organizing viewing events for the public, where I try and educate them on the research in the department, in addition to the observations. I connect astronomy research to everyday things that we take for granted; I feel this helps dispel the notion that science is a black box that merely spits predictions out of data. I have also been the public outreach coordinator in my department where I have helped organize outreach events and presented on several topics in physics and astronomy to school students and community groups in and around Columbia, Missouri.

You can find my presentations on the [resources page](/resources). You can download and reuse them!

During my graduate study, I have noticed a change in the public’s perception of science, especially during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. I felt that it was important to rebuild people’s trust in science and decided to pursue a graduate certificate in public engagement offered by this university. The coursework included essentials of public engagement and a year-long outreach project where I designed lesson plans for homeschooled children using inexpensive, day-to-day objects that can be found at home. Pursuing this certificate helped me learn how to effectively communicate science and my research with broader audiences from different age groups and diverse backgrounds. I also learned about science policy and got to interact with the elected representatives in Jefferson City, which gave me a new perspective on the intersection of science and society.

As I continue to grow as an educator and advocate for science education, my goal is to inspire a new generation of curious minds and empower marginalized communities to pursue their aspirations. By fostering inclusive learning environments and promoting equitable access to education, I aspire to contribute to a brighter and more equitable future for all.
