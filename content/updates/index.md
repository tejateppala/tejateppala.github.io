### July 9, 2025

I have successfully defended my PhD in Physics at the University of Missouri! My research explored how low-mass galaxies form stars in short, intense bursts — and what that reveals about galaxy evolution, feedback, and the interstellar medium.

### April 9, 2025

I had the incredible opportunity to represent the University of Missouri-Columbia at the 2025 American Association for the Advancement of Sciences (AAAS) Catalyzing Advocacy in Science and Engineering (CASE) Workshop in Washington, D.C. 

During the CASE Workshop, I engaged with science policy and advocacy experts about the role of science in policymaking, learned about the federal budget and appropriations process, and learned about the critical role of researchers in advocating for sustained federal research funding across STEM fields. 

As a part of the workshop, I met the legislative staff of Rep. Bob Onder (MO-3), Rep. Mark Alford (MO-4), Sen. Josh Hawley, and Sen. Eric Schmitt on Capitol Hill. During these visits, I shared personal stories and anecdotes on how the recent funding cuts and proposals have impacted the research and employment at Mizzou. I advocated for continued funding support in indirect costs, vital for maintaining the research centers and cores, especially the MU Research Reactor, which produces lifesaving radiopharmaceuticals for cancer treatment.
